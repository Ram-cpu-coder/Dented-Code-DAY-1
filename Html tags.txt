Gitbash
	why? - to give the commands of the Linux in windows
		technically it is converting the Linux commands to 		the commands being understood by window




---git commands in the git bash under the terminal of the VS code:----

git init  
	initialize the git

git status  
	to find and track the files

git add .  
	to stage all the files at a same time 

git add READ.md  
	to stage this file 

git commit -m
	to make the commit
git log 
	to see the history
 
git branch 
	to see the major branch of the project

git branch -M main 
	to make a new branch of the name 'main'

git remote -v
	to create the origin 
	to link the local repo to the cloud

git push -u origin main
	to push it to remote

git reset --hard //the id of the change which can be seen through the git log

	it simply reverts from the local not from the remote

git fetch origin 
	it shows what has been changed

git pull 
	to get the latest 


Note:  you can even copy all the codes and paste on the terminal at a time. so all of them work
